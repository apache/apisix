APISIX is a cloud-native microservices API gateway, delivering the ultimate performance, security, open source and scalable platform for all your APIs and microservices.

APISIX is based on Nginx and etcd. Compared with traditional API gateways, APISIX has dynamic routing and plug-in hot loading, which is especially suitable for API management under micro-service system.

## Why APISIX?

If you are building a website, mobile device or IoT (Internet of Things) application, you may need to use an API gateway to handle interface traffic.

APISIX is a cloud-based microservices API gateway that handles traditional north-south traffic and handles east-west traffic between services, and can also be used as a k8s ingress controller.

APISIX provides dynamic load balancing, authentication, rate limiting, other plugins through plugin mechanisms, and supports plugins you develop yourself.

For more detailed information, see the [White Paper](https://www.iresty.com/download/Choosing%20the%20Right%20Microservice%20API%20Gateway%20for%20the%20Enterprise%20User.pdf).

## Features
You can use Apache APISIX as a traffic entrance to process all business data, including dynamic routing, dynamic upstream, dynamic certificates,
A/B testing, canary release, blue-green deployment, limit rate, defense against malicious attacks, metrics, monitoring alarms, service observability, service governance, etc.

- **All platforms**
    - Cloud-Native: Platform agnostic, No vendor lock-in, APISIX can run from bare-metal to Kubernetes.
    - Run Environment: Both OpenResty and Tengine are supported.
    - Supports [ARM64](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/84467919): Don't worry about the lock-in of the infra technology.

- **Multi protocols**
    - [TCP/UDP Proxy](doc/stream-proxy.md): Dynamic TCP/UDP proxy.

    - Circuit-Breaker: Intelligent tracking of unhealthy upstream services.

- **Fine-grained routing**
    - [Supports full path matching and prefix matching](doc/router-radixtree.md#how-to-use-libradixtree-in-apisix)
    - [Support all Nginx built-in variables as conditions for routing](/doc/router-radixtree.md#how-to-filter-route-by-nginx-builtin-variable), so you can use `cookie`,` args`, etc. as routing conditions to implement canary release, A/B testing, etc.
    - Support [various operators as judgment conditions for routing](https://github.com/iresty/lua-resty-radixtree#operator-list), for example `{"arg_age", ">", 24}`
    - Support [custom route matching function](https://github.com/iresty/lua-resty-radixtree/blob/master/t/filter-fun.t#L10)
    - IPv6: Use IPv6 to match route.

    - Authentications: [key-auth](doc/plugins/key-auth.md), [JWT](doc/plugins/jwt-auth.md), [basic-auth](doc/plugins/basic-auth.md), [wolf-rbac](doc/plugins/wolf-rbac.md)
    - [IP Whitelist/Blacklist](doc/plugins/ip-restriction.md)
    - [IdP](doc/plugins/oauth.md): Support external authentication services, such as Auth0, okta, etc., users can use this to connect to OAuth 2.0 and other authentication methods.

    - [Limit-concurrency](doc/plugins/limit-conn.md)
    - Anti-ReDoS(Regular expression Denial of Service): Built-in policies to Anti ReDoS without configuration.

- **OPS friendly**
    - OpenTracing: [support Apache Skywalking and Zipkin](doc/plugins/zipkin.md)
    - Monitoring And Metrics: [Prometheus](doc/plugins/prometheus.md)
    - Clustering: APISIX nodes are stateless, creates clustering of the configuration center, please refer to [etcd Clustering Guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/v2/clustering.md).
    - Dashboard: Built-in dashboard to control APISIX.
    - Version Control: Supports rollbacks of operations.
    - CLI: start\stop\reload APISIX through the command line.
    - [Stand-alone mode](doc/stand-alone.md): Supports to load route rules from local yaml file, it is more friendly such as under the kubernetes(k8s).

## Installation

APISIX Installed and tested in the following systems(OpenResty MUST >= 1.15.8.1, or Tengine >= 2.3.2):

CentOS 7, Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 9, Debian 10, macOS, **ARM64** Ubuntu 18.04

Steps to install APISIX:
1. Installation runtime dependencies: OpenResty and etcd, refer to [documentation](doc/install-dependencies.md)
2. There are several ways to install Apache APISIX:
    - [Source Release](doc/how-to-build.md#installation-via-source-release)
    - [RPM package](doc/how-to-build.md#installation-via-rpm-package-centos-7) for CentOS 7
    - [Luarocks](doc/how-to-build.md#installation-via-luarocks-macos-not-supported)
    - [Docker](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix-docker)

## Quickstart

1. start server:

```shell
sudo apisix start
```

2. try limit count plugin

Limit count plugin is a good start to try APISIX,
you can follow the [documentation of limit count](doc/plugins/limit-count.md).

Then you can try more [plugins](doc/README.md#plugins).

## Dashboard
APISIX has built-in support for Dashboard, as follows:

1. Please make sure your machine has Node 8.12.0 or higher, or there will occur build issues.

2. Download the source codes of [Dashboard](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix-dashboard):
```
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix-dashboard.git
```

3. Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

4. Install dependencies then run build command:
```
git checkout <v1.0> #The tag version same to apisix.
yarn && yarn build:prod
```

5. Integration with APISIX
Copy the compiled files under `/dist` directory to the `apisix/dashboard` directory,
open `http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/dashboard/` in the browser.
Do not need to fill the user name and password, log in directly.

The dashboard allows any remote IP by default, and you can modify `allow_admin` in `conf/config.yaml` by yourself, to list the list of IPs allowed to access.

We provide an online dashboard [demo version](http://apisix.iresty.com), make it easier for you to understand APISIX.

## Benchmark

Using AWS's 8 core server, APISIX's QPS reach to 140,000 with a latency of only 0.2 ms.
