**Apache APISIX** is a dynamic, real-time, high-performance API Gateway.

APISIX API Gateway provides rich traffic management features such as load balancing, dynamic upstream, canary release, circuit breaking, authentication, observability, and more.

You can use **APISIX API Gateway** to handle traditional north-south traffic,
as well as east-west traffic between services.
It can also be used as a [k8s ingress controller](https://github.com/apache/apisix-ingress-controller).

  - [REST Admin API](docs/en/latest/admin-api.md): Using the REST Admin API to control Apache APISIX, which only allows 127.0.0.1 access by default, you can modify the `allow_admin` field in `conf/config.yaml` to specify a list of IPs that are allowed to call the Admin API. Also, note that the Admin API uses key auth to verify the identity of the caller. **The `admin_key` field in `conf/config.yaml` needs to be modified before deployment to ensure security**.
  - External Loggers: Export access logs to external log management tools. ([HTTP Logger](docs/en/latest/plugins/http-logger.md), [TCP Logger](docs/en/latest/plugins/tcp-logger.md), [Kafka Logger](docs/en/latest/plugins/kafka-logger.md), [UDP Logger](docs/en/latest/plugins/udp-logger.md), [RocketMQ Logger](docs/en/latest/plugins/rocketmq-logger.md), [SkyWalking Logger](docs/en/latest/plugins/skywalking-logger.md), [Alibaba Cloud Logging(SLS)](docs/en/latest/plugins/sls-logger.md), [Google Cloud Logging](docs/en/latest/plugins/google-cloud-logging.md), [Splunk HEC Logging](docs/en/latest/plugins/splunk-hec-logging.md), [File Logger](docs/en/latest/plugins/file-logger.md), [SolarWinds Loggly Logging](docs/en/latest/plugins/loggly.md), [TencentCloud CLS](docs/en/latest/plugins/tencent-cloud-cls.md)).

  - [Datadog](docs/en/latest/plugins/datadog.md): push custom metrics to the DogStatsD server, comes bundled with [Datadog agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/), over the UDP protocol. DogStatsD basically is an implementation of StatsD protocol which collects the custom metrics for Apache APISIX agent, aggregates it into a single data point and sends it to the configured Datadog server.
  - [Helm charts](https://github.com/apache/apisix-helm-chart)
  - [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/): Support secret management solution for accessing secrets from Vault secure storage backed in a low trust environment. Currently, RS256 keys (public-private key pairs) or secret keys can be linked from vault in jwt-auth authentication plugin using [APISIX Secret](docs/en/latest/terminology/secret.md) resource.

- **Highly scalable**
  - [Custom plugins](docs/en/latest/plugin-develop.md): Allows hooking of common phases, such as `rewrite`, `access`, `header filter`, `body filter` and `log`, also allows to hook the `balancer` stage.
  - [Plugin can be written in Java/Go/Python](docs/en/latest/external-plugin.md)

  - Custom load balancing algorithms: You can use custom load balancing algorithms during the `balancer` phase.
  - Custom routing: Support users to implement routing algorithms themselves.

- **Multi-Language support**
  - Apache APISIX is a multi-language gateway for plugin development and provides support via `RPC` and `Wasm`.
  ![Multi Language Support into Apache APISIX](docs/assets/images/external-plugin.png)
  - The RPC way, is the current way. Developers can choose the language according to their needs and after starting an independent process with the RPC, it exchanges data with APISIX through local RPC communication. Till this moment, APISIX has support for [Java](https://github.com/apache/apisix-java-plugin-runner), [Golang](https://github.com/apache/apisix-go-plugin-runner), [Python](https://github.com/apache/apisix-python-plugin-runner) and Node.js.
  - The Wasm or WebAssembly, is an experimental way. APISIX can load and run Wasm bytecode via APISIX [wasm plugin](https://github.com/apache/apisix/blob/master/docs/en/latest/wasm.md) written with the [Proxy Wasm SDK](https://github.com/proxy-wasm/spec#sdks). Developers only need to write the code according to the SDK and then compile it into a Wasm bytecode that runs on Wasm VM with APISIX.

- **Serverless**
  - [Lua functions](docs/en/latest/plugins/serverless.md): Invoke functions in each phase in APISIX.
  - [AWS Lambda](docs/en/latest/plugins/aws-lambda.md): Integration with AWS Lambda function as a dynamic upstream to proxy all requests for a particular URI to the AWS API gateway endpoint. Supports authorization via api key and AWS IAM access secret.
  - [Azure Functions](docs/en/latest/plugins/azure-functions.md): Seamless integration with Azure Serverless Function as a dynamic upstream to proxy all requests for a particular URI to the Microsoft Azure cloud.
  - [Apache OpenWhisk](docs/en/latest/plugins/openwhisk.md): Seamless integration with Apache OpenWhisk as a dynamic upstream to proxy all requests for a particular URI to your own OpenWhisk cluster.

## Benchmark

Using AWS's eight-core server, APISIX's QPS reaches 140,000 with a latency of only 0.2 ms.

[Benchmark script](benchmark/run.sh) has been open sourced, welcome to try and contribute.

[APISIX also works perfectly in AWS graviton3 C7g.](https://apisix.apache.org/blog/2022/06/07/installation-performance-test-of-apigateway-apisix-on-aws-graviton3)
