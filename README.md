**Apache APISIX** is a dynamic, real-time, high-performance API gateway.

APISIX provides rich traffic management features such as load balancing, dynamic upstream, canary release, circuit breaking, authentication, observability, and more.

You can use Apache APISIX to handle traditional north-south traffic,
as well as east-west traffic between services.
It can also be used as a [k8s ingress controller](https://github.com/apache/apisix-ingress-controller).

  - Custom routing: Support users to implement routing algorithms themselves.

## Get Started

### Configure and Installation

APISIX Installed and tested in the following systems:

CentOS 7, Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 9, Debian 10, macOS, **ARM64** Ubuntu 18.04

There are several ways to install the Apache Release version of APISIX:

1. Source code compilation (applicable to all systems)

   - Installation runtime dependencies: OpenResty and etcd, and compilation dependencies: luarocks. Refer to [install dependencies documentation](docs/en/latest/install-dependencies.md)
   - Download the latest source code release package:

     ```shell
     $ mkdir apisix-2.6
     $ wget https://downloads.apache.org/apisix/2.6/apache-apisix-2.6-src.tgz
     $ tar zxvf apache-apisix-2.6-src.tgz -C apisix-2.6
     ```

   - Install the dependenciesï¼š

     ```shell
     $ make deps
     ```

   - check version of APISIX:

     ```shell
     $ ./bin/apisix version
     ```

   - start APISIX:

     ```shell
     $ ./bin/apisix start
     ```

2. [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/apisix) ï¼ˆapplicable to all systemsï¼‰

   By default, the latest Apache release package will be pulled:

   ```shell
   $ docker pull apache/apisix
   ```

   The Docker image does not include `etcd`; you can refer to [docker compose example](https://github.com/apache/apisix-docker/tree/master/example) to start a test cluster.

3. RPM packageï¼ˆonly for CentOS 7ï¼‰

   - Installation runtime dependencies: OpenResty, etcd and OpenSSL develop library, refer to [install dependencies documentation](docs/en/latest/install-dependencies.md#centos-7)
   - install APISIXï¼š

   ```shell
   $ sudo yum install -y https://github.com/apache/apisix/releases/download/2.6/apisix-2.6-0.x86_64.rpm
   ```

   - check the version of APISIX:

     ```shell
     $ apisix version
     ```

   - start APISIX:

     ```shell
     $ apisix start
     ```

**Note**: Apache APISIX would not support the v2 protocol of etcd anymore since APISIX v2.0, and the minimum etcd version supported is v3.4.0. Please update etcd when needed. If you need to migrate your data from etcd v2 to v3, please follow [etcd migration guide](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/op-guide/v2-migration/).

### For Developer

1. For developers, you can use the latest master branch to experience more features

   The getting started guide is a great way to learn the basics of APISIX. Just follow the steps in [Getting Started](docs/en/latest/getting-started.md).

   Further, you can follow the documentation to try more [plugins](docs/en/latest/plugins.md).

3. Admin API

   Apache APISIX provides [REST Admin API](docs/en/latest/admin-api.md) to dynamic control the Apache APISIX cluster.

4. Plugin development

   You can refer to [plugin development guide](docs/en/latest/plugin-develop.md), and [sample plugin `echo`](docs/en/latest/plugins/echo.md) documentation and code implementation.

   Please note that Apache APISIX plugins' added, updated, deleted, etc., are hot-loaded without restarting the service.
