### Visoin
Apache APISIX is an open source API gateway designed to help developers connect any APIs securely and efficiently in any environment.

Managing thousands or tens of thousands of APIs and microservices in a multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environment is not an easy task.
There will be many challenges as authentication, observability, security, etc.

Apache APISIX, a community-driven project, hopes to help everyone better manage and use APIs through the power of developers.
Every developer's contribution will used by thousands of companies and served by billions of users.

### Milestones
Apache APISIX has relatively complete features for north-south traffic,
and will be iterated around the following directions in the next 6 months (if you have any ideas, feel free to create issue to discuss):
- More complete support for Gateway API on APISIX ingress controller
- Add support for service mesh
- User-friendly documentation
- More plugins for public cloud and SaaS services
