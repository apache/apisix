# If you want to set the specified configuration value, you can set the new
# in this file. For example if you want to specify the etcd address:
#
# deployment:
#   role: traditional
#   role_traditional:
#     config_provider: etcd
#   etcd:
#     host:
#       - http://127.0.0.1:2379
#
# To configure via environment variables, you can use `${{VAR}}` syntax. For instance:
#
# deployment:
#   role: traditional
#   role_traditional:
#     config_provider: etcd
#   etcd:
#     host:
#       - http://${{ETCD_HOST}}:2379
#
# And then run `export ETCD_HOST=$your_host` before `make init`.
#
# If the configured environment variable can't be found, an error will be thrown.
#
# Also, If you want to use default value when the environment variable not set,
# Use `${{VAR:=default_value}}` instead. For instance:
#
# deployment:
#   role: traditional
#   role_traditional:
#     config_provider: etcd
#   etcd:
#     host:
#       - http://${{ETCD_HOST:=localhost}}:2379
#
# This will find environment variable `ETCD_HOST` first, and if it's not exist it will use `localhost` as default value.
#
deployment:
  role: traditional
  role_traditional:
    config_provider: etcd
  admin:
    admin_key:
      - name: admin
        key: ''  # using fixed API token has security risk, please update it when you deploy to production environment. If passed empty then will be autogenerated by APISIX and will be written back here. Recommended is to use external mechanism to generate and store the token.
        role: admin
