APISIX is built on top of Nginx and [ngx_lua](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module) leveraging the power offered by LuaJIT. See [Why Apache APISIX chose Nginx and Lua to build API Gateway?](https://apisix.apache.org/blog/2021/08/25/why-apache-apisix-chose-nginx-and-lua/).

APISIX has two main parts:

1. APISIX core, Lua plugin, multi-language Plugin runtime, and the WASM plugin runtime.
2. Built-in Plugins that adds features for observability, security, traffic control, etc.

The APISIX core handles the important functions like matching Routes, load balancing, service discovery, configuration management, and provides a management API. It also includes APISIX Plugin runtime supporting Lua and multilingual Plugins (Go, Java , Python, JavaScript, etc) including the experimental WASM Plugin runtime.

APISIX also has a set of [built-in Plugins](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/batch-requests) that adds features like authentication, security, observability, etc. They are written in Lua.

## Here is an overview of the architecture

1.Nginx: APISIX is built on top of Nginx, an open source web server that is known for its high performance and scalability. Nginx acts as a reverse proxy and is responsible for routing the client requests to the appropriate backend service.

2.Lua: APISIX is implemented in Lua, a lightweight programming language that is easy to learn and highly extensible. Lua is used to write plugins and extensions that can be added to APISIX to add custom functionality.

3.Etcd: APISIX uses etcd, a distributed key-value store, to store its configuration data. The configuration data includes information about the backend services, the routes, and the plugins that are used by APISIX.

4.REST API: APISIX provides a REST API that can be used to configure and manage the gateway. The REST API allows developers to add new routes, plugins, and services, as well as modify the existing configuration.

5.Plugin System: APISIX has a plugin system that allows developers to extend the functionality of the gateway. APISIX provides a number of plugins out of the box, such as rate limiting, authentication, and SSL termination, but developers can also create their own custom plugins.

6.Load Balancing: APISIX provides load balancing capabilities out of the box. It can distribute traffic evenly across multiple backend services, improving reliability and scalability.

7.Caching: APISIX has a built-in caching system that can be used to cache responses from backend services. This can improve performance and reduce the load on the backend services.

8.Service Discovery: APISIX can use service discovery systems, such as Consul or ZooKeeper, to automatically discover backend services and configure routing accordingly.

9.Metrics: APISIX provides metrics and monitoring capabilities that can be used to monitor the performance of the gateway and the backend services.

## Request handling process

The diagram below shows how APISIX handles an incoming request and applies corresponding Plugins:

When a request arrives at APISIX, the following steps take place:

APISIX receives the request: When a client sends a request to the API, APISIX receives it and processes it. The request could be an HTTP request or any other protocol that APISIX supports.

Route matching: APISIX checks the incoming request against the configured routes to find a match. Each route is defined by a combination of a URI path, an HTTP method, and any additional criteria, such as headers or query parameters. If a match is found, APISIX proceeds to the next step.

Plugin execution: Once APISIX has identified the correct route, it executes the plugins associated with that route. Plugins can perform a variety of actions, such as authentication, rate limiting, request/response transformation, and more. The plugins are executed in the order specified in the configuration file.

Proxying: After all the plugins have been executed, APISIX proxies the request to the upstream service. The upstream service could be a web application, a microservice, or any other endpoint that can handle the request.

Response processing: When the upstream service returns a response, APISIX processes it according to the plugins associated with the route. Plugins can modify the response, add headers, or perform other actions.

Response delivery: Finally, APISIX delivers the response to the client. If any plugins have modified the response, the modified version is returned to the client.

## Plugin hierarchy

The chart below shows the order in which different types of Plugin are applied to a request:

![flow-plugin-internal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/apisix/master/docs/assets/images/flow-plugin-internal.png)

In APISIX, the order in which plugins are applied to a request is determined by the order in which they are specified in the configuration file. There are several different types of plugins that can be applied to a request, and they can be categorized into three main groups based on when they are executed:

Global plugins: These plugins are executed before any route-specific plugins and are applied to all incoming requests. Examples of global plugins include access control, request/response logging, and rate limiting. Global plugins can be added to the http level of the configuration file.

Route plugins: These plugins are executed after the global plugins and are applied only to requests that match a specific route. Examples of route plugins include authentication, request/response transformation, and traffic splitting. Route plugins can be added to the route level of the configuration file.

Service plugins: These plugins are executed after the route plugins and are applied only to requests that are routed to a specific upstream service. Examples of service plugins include load balancing, health checking, and circuit breaking. Service plugins can be added to the service level of the configuration file.

Within each group of plugins, the order in which they are applied is determined by their position in the configuration file. For example, if two global plugins are specified, the one that appears first in the file will be executed before the second one. Similarly, if two route plugins are specified for a particular route, the first one will be executed before the second one.

It's worth noting that some plugins may have dependencies on other plugins, meaning that they need to be executed in a specific order. In such cases, the order in which the plugins are specified in the configuration file becomes even more important. APISIX provides a flexible plugin system that allows developers to create custom plugins and define their execution order in the configuration file, enabling powerful and fine-grained control over the behavior of the API gateway.
