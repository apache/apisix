APISIX is built on top of Nginx and [ngx_lua](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module) leveraging the power offered by LuaJIT. See [Why Apache APISIX chose Nginx and Lua to build API Gateway?](https://apisix.apache.org/blog/2021/08/25/why-apache-apisix-chose-nginx-and-lua/).

APISIX has two main parts:

1. APISIX core, Lua plugin, multi-language Plugin runtime, and the WASM plugin runtime.
2. Built-in Plugins that adds features for observability, security, traffic control, etc.

The APISIX core handles the important functions like matching Routes, load balancing, service discovery, configuration management, and provides a management API. It also includes APISIX Plugin runtime supporting Lua and multilingual Plugins (Go, Java , Python, JavaScript, etc) including the experimental WASM Plugin runtime.

APISIX also has a set of [built-in Plugins](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/batch-requests) that adds features like authentication, security, observability, etc. They are written in Lua.

## Request handling process

The diagram below shows how APISIX handles an incoming request and applies corresponding Plugins:

## Plugin hierarchy

The chart below shows the order in which different types of Plugin are applied to a request:
