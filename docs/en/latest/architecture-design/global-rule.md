[Plugin](plugin.md) just can be binded to [Service](service.md) or [Route](route.md), if we want a [Plugin](plugin.md) work on all requests, how to do it?
We can register a global [Plugin](plugin.md) with `GlobalRule`:

```shell
curl -X PUT \
  https://{apisix_listen_address}/apisix/admin/global_rules/1 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' \
  -d '{
        "plugins": {
            "limit-count": {
                "time_window": 60,
                "policy": "local",
                "count": 2,
                "key": "remote_addr",
                "rejected_code": 503
            }
        }
    }'
```

Now, the `limit-count` plugin will work on all requests

we can list all `GlobalRule` via admin api as below:

```shell
curl https://{apisix_listen_address}/apisix/admin/global_rules
```
