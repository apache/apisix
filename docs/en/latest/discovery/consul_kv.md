## Summary

For users who used [nginx-upsync-module](https://github.com/weibocom/nginx-upsync-module) and consul key value for service discovery way, as we Weibo Mobile Team, maybe need it.

Thanks to @fatman-x guy, who developed this module, called `consul_kv`, and its worker process data flow is below:

## Configuration for discovery client

### Configuration for Consul KV

Add following configuration in `conf/config.yaml` :

```yaml
discovery:
  consul_kv:
    servers:
      - "http://127.0.0.1:8500"
      - "http://127.0.0.1:8600"
    prefix: "upstreams"
    skip_keys:                    # if you need to skip special keys
      - "upstreams/unused_api/"
    timeout:
      connect: 1000               # default 2000 ms
      read: 1000                  # default 2000 ms
      wait: 60                    # default 60 sec
    weight: 1                     # default 1
    fetch_interval: 5             # default 3 sec, only take effect for keepalive: false way
    keepalive: true               # default true, use the long pull way to query consul servers
    default_server:               # you can define default server when missing hit
      host: "127.0.0.1"
      port: 20999
      metadata:
        fail_timeout: 1           # default 1 ms
        weight: 1                 # default 1
        max_fails: 1              # default 1
```

And you can config it in short by default value:

```yaml
discovery:
  consul_kv:
    servers:
      - "http://127.0.0.1:8500"
```

The `keepalive` has two optional values:

- `true`, default and recommend value, use the long pull way to query consul servers
- `false`, not recommend, it would use the short pull way to query consul servers, then you can set the `fetch_interval` for fetch interval

### Register Http API Services

Service register Key&Value template:

```
Key:    {Prefix}/{Service_Name}/{IP}:{Port}
Value: {"weight": <Num>, "max_fails": <Num>, "fail_timeout": <Num>}
```

The register consul key use `upstreams` as prefix by default. The http api service name called `webpages` for example, and you can also use `webpages/oneteam/hello` as service name. The api instance of node's ip and port make up new key: `<IP>:<Port>`.

Now, register nodes into consul:

```shell
curl \
    -X PUT \
    -d ' {"weight": 1, "max_fails": 2, "fail_timeout": 1}' \
    http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/kv/upstreams/webpages/172.19.5.12:8000

curl \
    -X PUT \
    -d ' {"weight": 1, "max_fails": 2, "fail_timeout": 1}' \
    http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/kv/upstreams/webpages/172.19.5.13:8000
```

In some case, same keys exist in different consul servers.
To avoid confusion, use the full consul key url path as service name in practice.

### Upstream setting

Here is an example of routing a request with a URL of "/*" to a service which named "http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/kv/upstreams/webpages/" and use consul_kv discovery client in the registry :

```shell
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -i -d '
{
    "uri": "/*",
    "upstream": {
        "service_name": "http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/kv/upstreams/webpages/",
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "discovery_type": "consul_kv"
    }
}'
```

The format response as below:

```json
{
  "node": {
    "value": {
      "priority": 0,
      "update_time": 1612755230,
      "upstream": {
        "discovery_type": "consul_kv",
        "service_name": "http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/kv/upstreams/webpages/",
        "hash_on": "vars",
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "pass_host": "pass"
      },
      "id": "1",
      "uri": "/*",
      "create_time": 1612755230,
      "status": 1
    },
    "key": "/apisix/routes/1"
  },
  "action": "set"
}
```

You could find more usage in the `apisix/t/discovery/consul_kv.t` file.
