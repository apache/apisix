## Service discovery via Nacos

This is experimental discovery module for Nacos.

The performance of this module needs to be improved:

1. avoid synchroning configuration in each workers. You can refer the implementation in `consul_kv.lua`.
2. send the request parallelly.

### Configuration for Nacos

Add following configuration in `conf/config.yaml` :

```yaml
discovery:
  nacos:
    host:
      - "http://${username}:${password}@${host1}:${port1}"
    prefix: "/nacos/v1/"
    fetch_interval: 30    # default 30 sec
    weight: 100           # default 100
    timeout:
      connect: 2000       # default 2000 ms
      send: 2000          # default 2000 ms
      read: 5000          # default 5000 ms
```

And you can config it in short by default value:

```yaml
discovery:
  nacos:
    host:
      - "http://192.168.33.1:8848"
```

### Upstream setting

Here is an example of routing a request with a URL of "/nacos/*" to a service which named "http://192.168.33.1:8848/nacos/v1/ns/instance/list?serviceName=APISIX-NACOS" and use nacos discovery client in the registry :

```shell
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -i -d '
{
    "uri": "/nacos/*",
    "upstream": {
        "service_name": "APISIX-NACOS",
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "discovery_type": "nacos"
    }
}'
```

The format response as below:

```json
{
  "node": {
    "key": "\/apisix\/routes\/1",
    "value": {
      "id": "1",
      "create_time": 1615796097,
      "status": 1,
      "update_time": 1615799165,
      "upstream": {
        "hash_on": "vars",
        "pass_host": "pass",
        "scheme": "http",
        "service_name": "APISIX-NACOS",
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "discovery_type": "nacos"
      },
      "priority": 0,
      "uri": "\/nacos\/*"
    }
  },
  "action": "set"
}
```
