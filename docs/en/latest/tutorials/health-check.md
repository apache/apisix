## Description

This article mainly introduces the health check function of Apache APISIX. The health check function can proxy requests to healthy nodes when the upstream node fails or migrates, avoiding the problem of service unavailability to the greatest extent. The health check function of APISIX is implemented using [lua-resty-healthcheck](https://github.com/api7/lua-resty-healthcheck), which is divided into active check and passive check.

## Active check

Active health check mainly means that APISIX actively detects the survivability of upstream nodes through preset probe types. APISIX supports three probe types: `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, and `TCP`.

When N consecutive probes sent to healthy node `A` fail, the node will be marked as unhealthy, and the unhealthy node will be ignored by APISIX's load balancer and cannot receive requests; if For an unhealthy node, if M consecutive probes are successful, the node will be re-marked as healthy and can be proxied.

## Passive check

Passive health check refers to judging whether the corresponding upstream node is healthy by judging the response status of the request forwarded from APISIX to the upstream node. Compared with the active health check, the passive health check method does not need to initiate additional probes, but it cannot sense the node status in advance, and there may be a certain amount of failed requests.

If `N` consecutive requests to a healthy node A fail, the node will be marked as unhealthy.

:::note

Since unhealthy nodes cannot receive requests, nodes cannot be re-marked as healthy using the passive health check strategy alone, so combining the active health check strategy is usually necessary.

:::

:::tip

- We only start the health check when the upstream is hit by a request. There won't be any health check if an upstream is configured but isn't in used.
- If there is no healthy node can be chosen, we will continue to access the upstream.
- We won't start the health check when the upstream only has one node, as we will access it whether this unique node is healthy or not.

### Configuration example

You can enable health checks in routes via the Admin API:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/index.html",
    "plugins": {
        "limit-count": {
            "count": 2,
            "time_window": 60,
            "rejected_code": 503,
            "key": "remote_addr"
        }
    },
    "upstream": {
         "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1,
            "127.0.0.1:1970": 1
        },
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "retries": 2,
        "checks": {
            "active": {
                "timeout": 5,
                "http_path": "/status",
                "host": "foo.com",
                "healthy": {
                    "interval": 2,
                    "successes": 1
                },
                "unhealthy": {
                    "interval": 1,
                    "http_failures": 2
                },
                "req_headers": ["User-Agent: curl/7.29.0"]
            },
            "passive": {
                "healthy": {
                    "http_statuses": [200, 201],
                    "successes": 3
                },
                "unhealthy": {
                    "http_statuses": [500],
                    "http_failures": 3,
                    "tcp_failures": 3
                }
            }
        }
    }
}'
```

If APISIX detects an unhealthy node, the following logs will be output in the error log:

```shell
enabled healthcheck passive while logging request
failed to receive status line from 'nil (127.0.0.1:1980)': closed
unhealthy TCP increment (1/2) for '(127.0.0.1:1980)'
failed to receive status line from 'nil (127.0.0.1:1980)': closed
unhealthy TCP increment (2/2) for '(127.0.0.1:1980'
```

:::tip

To observe the above log information, you need to adjust the error log level to `info`.

:::

The health check status can be fetched via `GET /v1/healthcheck` in [Control API](./control-api.md).

```shell

curl http://127.0.0.1:9090/v1/healthcheck/upstreams/healthycheck -s | jq .

```
