## What is an API Gateway?

An [API gateway](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html) is an API management tool that acts as a mid layer service between a client and a number backend services. Typically, the API gateway receives the clients requests and processes it by summoning multiple microservices, aggregating the services and returning the appropriate results.

## What is Apache APISIX?

An [API gateway](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html) is an API management tool that acts as a mid-layer service between a client and a number of backend services. Typically, the API gateway receives the client's requests and processes them by summoning multiple microservices, aggregating the services, and returning the appropriate results.

## What is Apache APISIX

Apache APISIX is an open-source, dynamic and high-performance cloud-native API gateway that delivers the ultimate performance for all your APIs and microservices. Think of APISIX as a service bus that connects APIs and microservices in your cloud-native architecture.
Apache APISIX facilitates interface traffic handling for Websites, Mobile and IoT applications by providing services such as load balancing, dynamic upstream, grayscale publishing, refined routing, current and speed limiting, and many more.

### The problem APISIX solves?

  - Help enterprises to solve the difficulties in the transformation of traditional monolithic architecture, so as to achieve rapid iteration of business and products.
  - Apache APISIX replaces NGINX and handles traditional north-south traffic. It also replaces Envoy to handle east-west traffic between services.
  - Handles Layer 4 and Layer 7 traffic: HTTP, HTTPs, TCP, UDP, MQTT, Dubbo, gRPC, etc.
  - It can also be used as a [K8s ingress controller](https://github.com/apache/apisix-ingress-controller).
  - Use IdP plugin as Zero-Trust gateway
  - Easy to use: APISIX also consists of a built-in low-code dashboard that offers a powerful and flexible interface. You can write your own custom plugins or use custom load balancing algorithms.

## Features

Apache APISIX not only covers the traditional functions of NGINX, but also deeply cooperates with different observability platforms, which greatly improves service governance capabilities. Other characteristics of the Apache APISIX gateway includes:

  - Multi-Platform Support:
   APISIX is a cloud native, open source API gateway. You can run APISIX from bare-metal to Kubernetes. Since APISIX supports ARM64, it avoids the lock-in challenge of the infrastructure technology. It also provides integration to cloud providers like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Lua functions and Apache OpenWhisk.

  - Full Dynamic:
    The biggest feature of Apache APISIX is that it is fully dynamic. That includes routing, SSL certificates, plugins, upstream etc. It adopts hot-reloading so, every feature can be dynamically configured by the admin API, without having to restart the service at all.

  - Fine-Grained Routing:
    Support all Nginx built-in variables as conditions for routing, so you can use cookie, args, etc. as routing conditions to implement canary release, A/B testing, etc.  Apache APISIX provides operators that serve as judgment conditions for routing and a custom routing matching function. By using GraphQL attributes, APISIX allows you to filter routes.

  - OPS Friendly:
    Apache APISIX has been adopted amongst organisationâ€™s DevOps team because of it Ops-friendly strategy. it supports numerous tools and platforms like HashiCorp Vault, [Zipkin](https://github.com/Anita-ihuman/apisix/blob/Introduction/docs/en/latest/plugins/zipkin.md), [Apache SkyWalking](https://github.com/Anita-ihuman/apisix/blob/Introduction/docs/en/latest/plugins/skywalking.md), [Consul](https://github.com/Anita-ihuman/apisix/blob/Introduction/docs/en/latest/discovery/consul_kv.md), [Nacos](https://github.com/Anita-ihuman/apisix/blob/Introduction/docs/en/latest/discovery/nacos.md), [Eureka](https://github.com/Anita-ihuman/apisix/blob/Introduction/docs/en/latest/discovery.md), etc. With a user friendly [dashboard](https://github.com/apache/apisix-dashboard), Apache APISIX makes it is easy for users/admins to operate APISIX through a frontend interface.

  - Multi-Language Support:
    Apache APISIX is a multi-language gateway for plugin development and supports multiple languages via RPC and Wasm. Developers choose the language according to their needs and write the code according to the language-specific SDKs. The plugin can be integrated with APISIX by compiling it to Wasm (WebAssembly) bytecode. Optionally, developers can leverage the `plugin runners` to implement specific RPC methods (the actual business logic). Currently, APISIX supports plugin runners in Java, Golang, Python and Node.js.

## Summary

This guide walks through how you can get up and running with Apache APISIX.

The guide is divided into these three steps:

1. Installing Apache APISIX
2. Creating a Route and binding it with an Upstream
3. Verifying the results after binding with `curl`

This document also introduces some of the advanced features and operations in Apache APISIX like authentication, prefixing a Route, using the APISIX Dashboard, and troubleshooting.

The following `echo` endpoint is used as an example here. This endpoint will return the parameters we pass.

**Request**

The components of the request URL are shown and explained below:

![RequestURL](../../assets/images/requesturl.jpg)

- Protocol: The network transport protocol. `HTTP` protocol is used for this example.
- Port: The port. `80` is used for this example.
- Host: The host. `httpbin.org` is used for this example.
- Path: The path. `/get` is used for this example.
- Query Parameters: The query string. Two strings `foo1` and `foo2` are used for this example.

We can use the `curl` command to send the request:

```bash
curl --location --request GET "http://httpbin.org/get?foo1=bar1&foo2=bar2"
```

**Response**

We receive a JSON response when we send the request:

```json
{
  "args": {
    "foo1": "bar1",
    "foo2": "bar2"
  },
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.29.0",
    "X-Amzn-Trace-Id": "Root=1-6088fe84-24f39487166cce1f0e41efc9"
  },
  "origin": "58.152.81.42",
  "url": "http://httpbin.org/get?foo1=bar1&foo2=bar2"
}
```

## Pre-Requisites

Before you jump ahead, make sure that you have your machine setup with these tools.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

- [curl](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html) for testing the API. Alternatively, you can use tools like [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

:::note Note
If you already have Apache APISIX installed, please skip Step 1, and go to [Step 2](getting-started.md#step-2-create-a-route) directly.
:::

## Step 1: Install Apache APISIX

You can check out [Building Apache APISIX](./how-to-build.md) for different installation methods.

To get started quickly, we will install Apache APISIX with Docker and enable the [Admin API](./admin-api.md).

```bash
# Download the docker-compose file of Apache APISIX
git clone https://github.com/apache/apisix-docker.git
# Switch the current directory to the apisix-docker/example
cd apisix-docker/example
# Start Apache APISIX with docker-compose
docker-compose -p docker-apisix up -d
```

> Apache APISIX already supports ARM64 architecture. To run Apache APISIX on ARM64, run: `docker-compose -p docker-apisix -f docker-compose-arm64.yml up -d` instead of the last step above.

Please remain patient as it will take some time to download the files and spin up the containers.

Once Apache APISIX is running, you can use `curl` to access the Admin API. You can also check if Apache APISIX is running properly by running this command and checking the response.

```bash
# Execute on your host machine (machine running Docker)
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/services/" -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1'
```

This response indicates that Apache APISIX is running successfully.

```json
{
  "count":0,
  "action":"get",
  "node":{
    "key":"/apisix/services",
    "nodes":[],
    "dir":true
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Create a Route

[Routes](./architecture-design/route.md) matches the client's requests based on defined rules, loads and executes the corresponding plugins, and forwards the request to the specified upstream.

From the previous step, we have a running instance of Apache APISIX in Docker. Now let's create a Route.

Apache APISIX provides a powerful [Admin API](./admin-api.md) and [APISIX Dashboard](https://github.com/apache/apisix-dashboard). Here, we will use the Admin API to create a Route and connect it to an [Upstream](./architecture-design/upstream.md) service. When a request arrives, Apache APISIX will forward the request to the specified Upstream service.

We will create a sample configuration for our Route object so that Apache APISIX can forward the request to the corresponding Upstream service.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1" -H "X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1" -X PUT -d '
{
  "methods": ["GET"],
  "host": "example.com",
  "uri": "/anything/*",
  "upstream": {
    "type": "roundrobin",
    "nodes": {
      "httpbin.org:80": 1
    }
  }
}'
```

This configuration means that it will forward all matching inbound requests to the upstream service (`httpbin.org:80`) if they meet these specified criterion.

- The HTTP method of the request is `GET`.
- The request header contains the `host` field, and its value is `example.com`.
- The request path matches `/anything/*`. `*` means any sub path. For example `/anything/foo?arg=10`.

Now that the Route has been created, we can access the Upstream service from the address exposed by Apache APISIX.

```bash
curl -i -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:9080/anything/foo?arg=10" -H "Host: example.com"
```

This request will be forwarded to `http://httpbin.org:80/anything/foo?arg=10` by Apache APISIX.

### Create an Upstream

In the previous session we discussed setting up a Route and an Upstream for the Route.

To create an Upstream, we can execute the following command.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/upstreams/1" -H "X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1" -X PUT -d '
{
  "type": "roundrobin",
  "nodes": {
    "httpbin.org:80": 1
  }
}'
```

We use `roundrobin` as the load balancing mechanism and set `httpbin.org:80` as our Upstream service with an ID of `1`. See [Admin API](./admin-api.md) for more information about the fields.

#    Please refer to https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/admonitions
#    for more detail.
#
-->

:::note Note
Creating an Upstream service is not mandatory as we can use a [Plugin](./architecture-design/plugin.md) to intercept the request and then respond directly. However, for the purposes of this guide, we assume that at least one Upstream service needs to be set up.
:::

### Binding the Route to the Upstream

We can now bind a Route to the Upstream service we just created.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1" -H "X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1" -X PUT -d '
{
  "uri": "/get",
  "host": "httpbin.org",
  "upstream_id": "1"
}'
```

## Step 3: Validating the Route

We will now access Apache APISIX to test the Route and the bounded Upstream service.

```bash
curl -i -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:9080/get?foo1=bar1&foo2=bar2" -H "Host: httpbin.org"
```

This will return the data from the Upstream service we configured in our route (`httpbin.org`).

## Advanced Features and Operations

This section looks at some of the advanced features and operations available in Apache APISIX like [authentication](#authentication), [prefixing a Route](#prefixing-a-route), using the [APISIX Dashboard](#apisix-dashboard), and [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

### Authentication

The Route we created in [step 2](#step-2-create-a-route) is public. This means that anyone knowing the address exposed by Apache APISIX can access the Upstream service.

This is unsafe and amounts to security risks. So, in practical applications, we generally add authentication to the Route to enhance security.

Let's assume for our scenario that we only want a specific user `John` to have access to the Upstream service.

We will use [Consumer](./architecture-design/consumer.md) a [Plugin](./architecture-design/plugin.md) to implement authentication to handle this scenario.

First, we will use the [key-auth](./plugins/key-auth.md) plugin to create a [Consumer](./architecture-design/consumer.md) `John`. We also need to provide the specified key for `John`.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/consumers" -H "X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1" -X PUT -d '
{
  "username": "john",
  "plugins": {
    "key-auth": {
      "key": "key-of-john"
    }
  }
}'
```

We can now bind `consumer(John)` to the Route. For this, we just need to enable the [key-auth](./plugins/key-auth.md) plugin as shown below.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1" -H "X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1" -X PUT -d '
{
  "uri": "/get",
  "host": "httpbin.org",
  "plugins": {
    "key-auth": {}
  },
  "upstream_id": "1"
}'
```

Now with the authentication added, when we try to access the Route we created in [step 2](#step-2-create-a-route) it will trigger an "Unauthorized Error".

To access the Route, we need to add a `Header` named `apikey` with John's key.

```bash
curl -i -X GET http://127.0.0.1:9080/get -H "Host: httpbin.org" -H "apikey: key-of-john"
```

### Prefixing a Route

When you want to add a prefix to your Route but don't want to use the `Host` header, you can use the `proxy-rewrite` Plugin.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1" -H "X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1" -X PUT -d '
{
  "uri": "/samplePrefix/get",
  "plugins": {
    "proxy-rewrite": {
      "regex_uri": ["^/samplePrefix/get(.*)", "/get$1"]
    },
    "key-auth": {}
  },
  "upstream_id": "1"
}'
```

Then to invoke the Route you can run:

```bash
curl -i -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:9080/samplePrefix/get?param1=foo&param2=bar" -H "apikey: key-of-john"
```

### APISIX Dashboard

Apache APISIX comes with an intuitive [Dashboard](https://github.com/apache/apisix-dashboard) to make it easy to configure and perform operations.

### Troubleshooting

You can try these troubleshooting steps if you are unable to proceed as suggested in the docs above.

Please [open an issue](/docs/general/contributor-guide#submit-an-issue) if you run into any bugs or if there are any missing troubleshooting steps.

- Make sure that all required ports (**default 9080/9443/2379**) are available (not used by other systems or processes).

    You can run the command below to terminate the processes that are listening on a specific port (on Unix-based systems).

    ```bash
    sudo fuser -k 9443/tcp
    ```

- If the Docker container keeps restarting or IS failing, log in to the container and observe the logs to diagnose the problem.

    ```bash
    docker logs -f --tail container_id
    ```
