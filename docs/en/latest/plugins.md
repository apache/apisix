## Hot reload

APISIX plugins are hot-loaded. No matter you add, delete or modify plugins, and **update codes of plugins in disk**, you don't need to restart the service.

If your APISIX node has the Admin API turned on, just send an HTTP request through admin API:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/plugins/reload -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT
```

Note: if you disable a plugin which has been configured as part of your rule (in the `plugins` field of `route`, etc.),
the its execution will be skipped.

### Hot reload in stand-alone mode

For stand-alone mode, see plugin related section in [stand alone mode](stand-alone.md).
