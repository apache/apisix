## Health Checks for Upstream

Health Check of APISIX is based on [lua-resty-healthcheck](https://github.com/Kong/lua-resty-healthcheck),
you can use it for upstream.

Note:

* We only start the health check when the upstream is hit by a request.
There won't be any health check if an upstream is configured but isn't in used.
* If there is no healthy node can be chosen, we will continue to access the upstream.
* We won't start the health check when the upstream only has one node, as we will access
it whether this unique node is healthy or not.

The following is an example of health check:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '

                "req_headers": ["User-Agent: curl/7.29.0"]
            },

                },
                "unhealthy": {
                    "http_statuses": [500],
                    "http_failures": 3,
                    "tcp_failures": 3
                }
            }
        }
    }
}'
```

The configures in `checks` are belong to health check, the type of `checks`
contains: `active` or `passive`.

* `active`: To enable active health checks, you need to specify the configuration items under `checks.active` in the Upstream object configuration.

  * `active.timeout`: Socket timeout for active checks (in seconds), support decimals. For example `1.01` means `1010` milliseconds, `2` means `2000` milliseconds.

  * `active.http_path`: The HTTP GET request path used to detect if the upstream is healthy.
  * `active.host`: The HTTP request host used to detect if the upstream is healthy.
  * `active.port`: The customize health check host port (optional), this will override the port in the `upstream` node.

  The threshold fields of `healthy` are:
  * `active.healthy.interval`: Interval between health checks for healthy targets (in seconds), the minimum is 1.
  * `active.healthy.successes`: The number of success times to determine the target is healthy, the minimum is 1.

  The threshold fields of  `unhealthy` are:
  * `active.unhealthy.interval`: Interval between health checks for unhealthy targets (in seconds), the minimum is 1.
  * `active.unhealthy.http_failures`: The number of http failures times to determine the target is unhealthy, the minimum is 1.
  * `active.req_headers`: Additional request headers. Array format, so you can fill in multiple headers.

* `passive`: To enable passive health checks, you need to specify the configuration items under `checks.passive` in the Upstream object configuration.

  The threshold fields of `healthy` are:
  * `passive.healthy.http_statuses`: If the current response code is equal to any of these, set the upstream node to the `healthy` state. Otherwise ignore this request.
  * `passive.healthy.successes`: Number of successes in proxied traffic (as defined by `passive.healthy.http_statuses`) to consider a target healthy, as observed by passive health checks.

  The threshold fields of `unhealthy` are:
  * `passive.unhealthy.http_statuses`: If the current response code is equal to any of these, set the upstream node to the `unhealthy` state. Otherwise ignore this request.
  * `passive.unhealthy.tcp_failures`: Number of TCP failures in proxied traffic to consider a target unhealthy, as observed by passive health checks.
  * `passive.unhealthy.timeouts`: Number of timeouts in proxied traffic to consider a target unhealthy, as observed by passive health checks.
  * `passive.unhealthy.http_failures`: Number of HTTP failures in proxied traffic (as defined by `passive.unhealthy.http_statuses`) to consider a target unhealthy, as observed by passive health checks.

The health check status can be fetched via `GET /v1/healthcheck` in [control API](./control-api.md).
