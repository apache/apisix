Apache APISIX is highly customizable with a lot of configuration options. By default it uses the [`conf/config-default.yaml`](https://github.com/apache/apisix/blob/master/conf/config-default.yaml) file for configuration. The configuration defined in this file can be overridden by adding the desired configuration to the `conf/config.yaml` file, for any unconfigured options it will fallback to default configurations. Given below are the types of the configuration file and their uses.

| File Name                  | Description                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `conf/config-default.yaml` | Default configuration, **Do not edit this file**                                  |
| `conf/config.yaml`         | Add your desired configuration to this file, overrides `conf/config-default.yaml` |
| `conf/apisix.yaml`         | Configuration file is required for APISIX in standalone mode. |
| `conf/debug.yaml`          | Add debug mode configuration in this file. |

You can also pass a custom config file on a custom path using `--config` or `-c` flags while starting APISIX. This will override the configurations defined in `conf/config.yaml` file.

```bash
apisix start --config <custom-path-to-config-file>
```
