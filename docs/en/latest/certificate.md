`APISIX` supports to load multiple SSL certificates by TLS extension Server Name Indication (SNI).

### Single SNI

It is most common for an SSL certificate to contain only one domain. We can create an `ssl` object. Here is a simple case, creates a `ssl` object and `route` object.

* `cert`: PEM-encoded public certificate of the SSL key pair.
* `key`: PEM-encoded private key of the SSL key pair.
* `snis`: Hostname(s) to associate with this certificate as SNIs. To set this attribute this certificate must have a valid private key associated with it.

We will use the Python script below to simplify the example:

```python title="create-ssl.py"
#!/usr/bin/env python
# coding: utf-8
import sys
# sudo pip install requests
import requests

if len(sys.argv) <= 3:
    print("bad argument")
    sys.exit(1)
with open(sys.argv[1]) as f:
    cert = f.read()
with open(sys.argv[2]) as f:
    key = f.read()
sni = sys.argv[3]
api_key = "edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1"
resp = requests.put("http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/ssls/1", json={
    "cert": cert,
    "key": key,
    "snis": [sni],
}, headers={
    "X-API-KEY": api_key,
})
print(resp.status_code)
print(resp.text)
```

```shell
# create SSL object
./create-ssl.py t.crt t.key test.com

# create Router object
curl http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -i -d '
{
    "uri": "/hello",
    "hosts": ["test.com"],
    "methods": ["GET"],
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'

# make a test

curl --resolve 'test.com:9443:127.0.0.1' https://test.com:9443/hello  -vvv
* Added test.com:9443:127.0.0.1 to DNS cache
* About to connect() to test.com port 9443 (#0)
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to test.com (127.0.0.1) port 9443 (#0)
* Initializing NSS with certpath: sql:/etc/pki/nssdb
* skipping SSL peer certificate verification
* SSL connection using TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
* Server certificate:
* 	subject: CN=test.com,O=iresty,L=ZhuHai,ST=GuangDong,C=CN
* 	start date: Jun 24 22:18:05 2019 GMT
* 	expire date: May 31 22:18:05 2119 GMT
* 	common name: test.com
* 	issuer: CN=test.com,O=iresty,L=ZhuHai,ST=GuangDong,C=CN
> GET /hello HTTP/1.1
> User-Agent: curl/7.29.0
> Host: test.com:9443
> Accept: */*
```

### wildcard SNI

Sometimes, one SSL certificate may contain a wildcard domain like `*.test.com`,
that means it can accept more than one domain, eg: `www.test.com` or `mail.test.com`.

Here is an example, note that the value we pass as `sni` is `*.test.com`.

```shell
./create-ssl.py t.crt t.key '*.test.com'

curl http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -i -d '
{
    "uri": "/hello",
    "hosts": ["*.test.com"],
    "methods": ["GET"],
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'

# make a test

curl --resolve 'www.test.com:9443:127.0.0.1' https://www.test.com:9443/hello  -vvv
* Added test.com:9443:127.0.0.1 to DNS cache
* About to connect() to test.com port 9443 (#0)
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to test.com (127.0.0.1) port 9443 (#0)
* Initializing NSS with certpath: sql:/etc/pki/nssdb
* skipping SSL peer certificate verification
* SSL connection using TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
* Server certificate:
* 	subject: CN=test.com,O=iresty,L=ZhuHai,ST=GuangDong,C=CN
* 	start date: Jun 24 22:18:05 2019 GMT
* 	expire date: May 31 22:18:05 2119 GMT
* 	common name: test.com
* 	issuer: CN=test.com,O=iresty,L=ZhuHai,ST=GuangDong,C=CN
> GET /hello HTTP/1.1
> User-Agent: curl/7.29.0
> Host: test.com:9443
> Accept: */*
```

### multiple domain

If your SSL certificate may contain more than one domain, like `www.test.com`
and `mail.test.com`, then you can add them into the `snis` array. For example:

```json
{
    "snis": ["www.test.com", "mail.test.com"]
}
```

### multiple certificates for a single domain

If you want to configure multiple certificate for a single domain, for
instance, supporting both the
[ECC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography)
and RSA key-exchange algorithm, then just configure the extra certificates (the
first certificate and private key should be still put in `cert` and `key`) and
private keys by `certs` and `keys`.

* `certs`: PEM-encoded certificate array.
* `keys`: PEM-encoded private key array.

`APISIX` will pair certificate and private key with the same indice as a SSL key
pair. So the length of `certs` and `keys` must be same.

### set up multiple CA certificates

APISIX currently uses CA certificates in several places, such as [Protect Admin API](./mtls.md#protect-admin-api), [etcd with mTLS](./mtls.md#etcd-with-mtls), and [Deployment Modes](./deployment-modes.md).

In these places, `ssl_trusted_certificate` or `trusted_ca_cert` will be used to set up the CA certificate, but these configurations will eventually be translated into [lua_ssl_trusted_certificate](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_ssl_trusted_certificate) directive in OpenResty.

If you need to set up different CA certificates in different places, then you can package these CA certificates into a CA bundle file and point to this file when you need to set up CAs. This will avoid the problem that the generated `lua_ssl_trusted_certificate` has multiple locations and overwrites each other.

The following is a complete example to show how to set up multiple CA certificates in APISIX.

Suppose we let client and APISIX Admin API, APISIX and ETCD communicate with each other using mTLS protocol, and currently there are two CA certificates, `foo_ca.crt` and `bar_ca.crt`, and use each of these two CA certificates to issue client and server certificate pairs, `foo_ca.crt` and its issued certificate pair are used to protect Admin API, and `bar_ca.crt` and its issued certificate pair are used to protect ETCD.

The following table details the configurations involved in this example and what they do:

| Configuration    | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |

1. Create CA bundle files

```shell
cat /path/to/foo_ca.crt /path/to/bar_ca.crt > apisix.ca-bundle
```

2. Start the ETCD cluster and enable client authentication

Start by writing a `goreman` configuration named `Procfile-single-enable-mtls`, the content as:

```text
# Use goreman to run `go get github.com/mattn/goreman`
etcd1: etcd --name infra1 --listen-client-urls https://127.0.0.1:12379 --advertise-client-urls https://127.0.0.1:12379 --listen-peer-urls http://127.0.0.1:12380 --initial-advertise-peer-urls http://127.0.0.1:12380 --initial-cluster-token etcd-cluster-1 --initial-cluster 'infra1=http://127.0.0.1:12380,infra2=http://127.0.0.1:22380,infra3=http://127.0.0.1:32380' --initial-cluster-state new --cert-file /path/to/bar_etcd.crt --key-file /path/to/bar_etcd.key --client-cert-auth --trusted-ca-file /path/to/apisix.ca-bundle
etcd2: etcd --name infra2 --listen-client-urls https://127.0.0.1:22379 --advertise-client-urls https://127.0.0.1:22379 --listen-peer-urls http://127.0.0.1:22380 --initial-advertise-peer-urls http://127.0.0.1:22380 --initial-cluster-token etcd-cluster-1 --initial-cluster 'infra1=http://127.0.0.1:12380,infra2=http://127.0.0.1:22380,infra3=http://127.0.0.1:32380' --initial-cluster-state new --cert-file /path/to/bar_etcd.crt --key-file /path/to/bar_etcd.key --client-cert-auth --trusted-ca-file /path/to/apisix.ca-bundle
etcd3: etcd --name infra3 --listen-client-urls https://127.0.0.1:32379 --advertise-client-urls https://127.0.0.1:32379 --listen-peer-urls http://127.0.0.1:32380 --initial-advertise-peer-urls http://127.0.0.1:32380 --initial-cluster-token etcd-cluster-1 --initial-cluster 'infra1=http://127.0.0.1:12380,infra2=http://127.0.0.1:22380,infra3=http://127.0.0.1:32380' --initial-cluster-state new --cert-file /path/to/bar_etcd.crt --key-file /path/to/bar_etcd.key --client-cert-auth --trusted-ca-file /path/to/apisix.ca-bundle
```

Use `goreman` to start the ETCD cluster:

```shell
goreman -f Procfile-single-enable-mtls start > goreman.log 2>&1 &
```

3. Update `config.yaml`

```yaml title="conf/config.yaml"
deployment:
  admin:
    admin_key
      - name: admin
        key: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1
        role: admin
    admin_listen:
      ip: 127.0.0.1
      port: 9180
    https_admin: true
    admin_api_mtls:
      admin_ssl_ca_cert: /path/to/apisix.ca-bundle
      admin_ssl_cert: /path/to/foo_server.crt
      admin_ssl_cert_key: /path/to/foo_server.key

apisix:
  ssl:
    ssl_trusted_certificate: /path/to/apisix.ca-bundle

deployment:
  role: traditional
  role_traditional:
    config_provider: etcd
  etcd:
    host:
      - "https://127.0.0.1:12379"
      - "https://127.0.0.1:22379"
      - "https://127.0.0.1:32379"
    tls:
      cert: /path/to/bar_apisix.crt
      key: /path/to/bar_apisix.key
      sni: etcd.cluster.dev
```

4. Test APISIX Admin API

Start APISIX, if APISIX starts successfully and there is no abnormal output in `logs/error.log`, it means that mTLS communication between APISIX and ETCD is normal.

Use curl to simulate a client, communicate with APISIX Admin API with mTLS, and create a route:

```shell
curl -vvv \
    --resolve 'admin.apisix.dev:9180:127.0.0.1' https://admin.apisix.dev:9180/apisix/admin/routes/1 \
    --cert /path/to/foo_client.crt \
    --key /path/to/foo_client.key \
    --cacert /path/to/apisix.ca-bundle \
    -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -i -d '
{
    "uri": "/get",
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "httpbin.org:80": 1
        }
    }
}'
```

A successful mTLS communication between curl and the APISIX Admin API is indicated if the following SSL handshake process is output:

```shell
* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS handshake, Client hello (1):
* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Server hello (2):
* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Encrypted Extensions (8):
* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Request CERT (13):
* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Certificate (11):
* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, CERT verify (15):
* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Finished (20):
* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS change cipher, Change cipher spec (1):
* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS handshake, Certificate (11):
* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS handshake, CERT verify (15):
* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS handshake, Finished (20):
* SSL connection using TLSv1.3 / TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
```

5. Verify APISIX proxy

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/get -i

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 298
Connection: keep-alive
Date: Tue, 26 Jul 2022 16:31:00 GMT
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Server: APISIX/2.14.1

...
```

APISIX proxied the request to the `/get` path of the upstream `httpbin.org` and returned `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`. The whole process is working fine using CA bundle instead of CA certificate.
