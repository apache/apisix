## Name

The `ext-plugin-pre-req` runs specific external plugins in the plugin runner, before
executing any builtin Lua plugins.

To know what is the plugin runner, see [external plugin](../external-plugin.md) section.

The result of external plugins execution will affect the behavior of the current request.

## How To Enable

Here's an example, enable this plugin on the specified route:

```shell
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1  -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/index.html",
    "plugins": {
        "ext-plugin-pre-req": {
            "conf" : [
                {"name": "ext-plugin-A", "value": "{\"enable\":\"feature\"}"}
            ]
    },
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "39.97.63.215:80": 1
        }
    }
}'
```

## Test Plugin

Use curl to access:

```shell
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9080/index.html
```

You will see the configured plugin runner will be hit and plugin `ext-plugin-A`
is executed at that side.

## Disable Plugin

When you want to disable this plugin, it is very simple,
you can delete the corresponding json configuration in the plugin configuration,
no need to restart the service, it will take effect immediately:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1  -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/index.html",
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "39.97.63.215:80": 1
        }
    }
}'
```

This plugin has been disabled now. It works for other plugins.
