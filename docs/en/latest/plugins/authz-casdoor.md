## Description

The `authz-casdoor` Plugin can be used to add centralized authentication with [Casdoor](https://casdoor.org/).

## Attributes

| Name          | Type   | Required | Description                                  |
|---------------|--------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| endpoint_addr | string | True     | URL of Casdoor.                              |
| client_id     | string | True     | Client ID in Casdoor.                        |
| client_secret | string | True     | Client secret in Casdoor.                    |
| callback_url  | string | True     | Callback URL used to receive state and code. |

NOTE: `encrypt_fields = {"client_secret"}` is also defined in the schema, which means that the field will be stored encrypted in etcd. See [encrypted storage fields](../plugin-develop.md#encrypted-storage-fields).

:::info IMPORTANT

`endpoint_addr` and `callback_url` should not end with '/'.

:::

:::info IMPORTANT

The `callback_url` must belong to the URI of your Route. See the code snippet below for an example configuration.

:::

## Enabling the Plugin

You can enable the Plugin on a specific Route as shown below:

```shell
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/1" -H "X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1" -X PUT -d '
{
  "methods": ["GET"],
  "uri": "/anything/*",
  "plugins": {
    "authz-casdoor": {
        "endpoint_addr":"http://localhost:8000",
        "callback_url":"http://localhost:9080/anything/callback",
        "client_id":"7ceb9b7fda4a9061ec1c",
        "client_secret":"3416238e1edf915eac08b8fe345b2b95cdba7e04"
    }
  },
  "upstream": {
    "type": "roundrobin",
    "nodes": {
      "httpbin.org:80": 1
    }
  }
}'
```

## Example usage

Once you have enabled the Plugin, a new user visiting this Route would first be processed by the `authz-casdoor` Plugin. They would be redirected to the login page of Casdoor.

After successfully logging in, Casdoor will redirect this user to the `callback_url` with GET parameters `code` and `state` specified. The Plugin will also request for an access token and confirm whether the user is really logged in. This process is only done once and subsequent requests are left uninterrupted.

Once this is done, the user is redirected to the original URL they wanted to visit.

## Disable Plugin

To disable the `authz-casdoor` Plugin, you can delete the corresponding JSON configuration from the Plugin configuration. APISIX will automatically reload and you do not have to restart for this to take effect.

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/1  -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "methods": ["GET"],
    "uri": "/anything/*",
    "plugins": {},
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "httpbin.org:80": 1
        }
    }
}'
```
