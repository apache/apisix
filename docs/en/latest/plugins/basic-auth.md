## How To Enable

### 1. set a consumer and config the value of the `basic-auth` option

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/consumers -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "username": "foo",
    "plugins": {
        "basic-auth": {
            "username": "foo",
            "password": "bar"
        }
    }
}'
```

you can visit Dashboard `http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/dashboard/` and add a Consumer through the web console:

then add basic-auth plugin in the Consumer page:

![auth-2](../../../assets/images/plugin/basic-auth-2.png)

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "methods": ["GET"],
    "uri": "/hello",
