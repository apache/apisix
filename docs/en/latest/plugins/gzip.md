## Description

The `gzip` Plugin dynamically sets the behavior of [gzip in Nginx](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/compression/).
When the `gzip` plugin is enabled, the client needs to include `Accept-Encoding: gzip` in the request header to indicate support for gzip compression. Upon receiving the request, APISIX dynamically determines whether to compress the response content based on the client's support and server configuration. If the conditions are met, `APISIX` adds the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to the response, indicating that the response content has been compressed using gzip. Upon receiving the response, the client uses the corresponding decompression algorithm based on the `Content-Encoding` header to decompress the response content and obtain the original response content.

:::info IMPORTANT

This Plugin requires APISIX to run on [APISIX-Runtime](../FAQ.md#how-do-i-build-the-apisix-runtime-environment).

## Enable Plugin

The example below enables the `gzip` Plugin on the specified Route:

:::note
You can fetch the `admin_key` from `config.yaml` and save to an environment variable with the following command:

```bash
admin_key=$(yq '.deployment.admin.admin_key[0].key' conf/config.yaml | sed 's/"//g')
```

:::

```shell
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/1  -H "X-API-KEY: $admin_key" -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/index.html",
    "plugins": {
        "gzip": {
            "buffers": {
                "number": 8
            }
        }
    },
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'
```

## Example usage

Once you have configured the Plugin as shown above, you can make a request as shown below:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/index.html -i -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip"
```

```
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: keep-alive
Date: Wed, 21 Jul 2021 03:52:55 GMT
Server: APISIX/2.7
Content-Encoding: gzip

Warning: Binary output can mess up your terminal. Use "--output -" to tell
Warning: curl to output it to your terminal anyway, or consider "--output
Warning: <FILE>" to save to a file.
```

## Delete Plugin

To remove the `gzip` Plugin, you can delete the corresponding JSON configuration from the Plugin configuration. APISIX will automatically reload and you do not have to restart for this to take effect.

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/1  -H "X-API-KEY: $admin_key" -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/index.html",
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'
```
