**Key can be customized by the user, only need to modify a line of code of the plug-in to complete. It is a security consideration that is not open in the plugin.**

## How To Enable

Here's an example, enable the limit-conn plugin on the specified route:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "methods": ["GET"],
    "uri": "/index.html",
    "plugins": {
        "limit-conn": {
            "conn": 1,
            "burst": 0,
            "default_conn_delay": 0.1,
            "rejected_code": 503,
            "key": "remote_addr"
        }
    },
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "39.97.63.215:80": 1
        }
    }
}'
```

You can open dashboard with a browser: `http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/dashboard/`, to complete the above operation through the web interface, first add a route:
![](../../../assets/images/plugin/limit-conn-1.png)

Then add limit-conn plugin:
![](../../../assets/images/plugin/limit-conn-2.png)

## Test Plugin

The parameters of the plugin enabled above indicate that only one concurrent request is allowed. When more than one concurrent request is received, will return `503` directly.

```shell
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9080/index.html?sleep=20 &

curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9080/index.html?sleep=20
<html>
<head><title>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</h1></center>
<hr><center>openresty</center>
</body>
</html>
```

This means that the limit request concurrency plugin is in effect.

## Disable Plugin

When you want to disable the limit-conn plugin, it is very simple,
you can delete the corresponding json configuration in the plugin configuration,
no need to restart the service, it will take effect immediately:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "methods": ["GET"],
    "uri": "/index.html",
    "id": 1,
    "plugins": {
    },
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "39.97.63.215:80": 1
        }
    }
}'
```

The limit-conn plugin has been disabled now. It works for other plugins.
