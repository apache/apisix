## How To Enable

To enable this plugin, we need to enable the stream_proxy configuration in `conf/config.yaml` first.
For example, the following configuration represents listening on the 9100 TCP port.

```yaml
    ...
    router:
        http: 'radixtree_uri'
        ssl: 'radixtree_sni'
    stream_proxy:                 # TCP/UDP proxy
      tcp:                        # TCP proxy port list
        - 9100
    dns_resolver:
    ...
```

Then send the MQTT request to port 9100.

Creates a stream route, and enable plugin `mqtt-proxy`.

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/stream_routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '

    "plugins": {
        "mqtt-proxy": {
            "protocol_name": "MQTT",
            "protocol_level": 4,
            "upstream": {
                "ip": "127.0.0.1",
                "port": 1980
            }
        }
    }
}'
