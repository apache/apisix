## Description

The `hmac-auth` Plugin adds [HMAC authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) to a Route or a Service.

This Plugin works with a [Consumer](../terminology/consumer.md) object and a consumer of your API has to add its key to the request header for verification.

NOTE: `encrypt_fields = {"secret_key"}` is also defined in the schema, which means that the field will be stored encrypted in etcd. See [encrypted storage fields](../plugin-develop.md#encrypted-storage-fields).

## Enabling the Plugin

First we enable the Plugin on a Consumer object as shown below:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/consumers -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "username": "jack",
    "plugins": {
        "hmac-auth": {
            "access_key": "user-key",
            "secret_key": "my-secret-key",
            "clock_skew": 0,
            "signed_headers": ["User-Agent", "Accept-Language", "x-custom-a"]
        }
    }
}'
```

You can also use the [APISIX Dashboard](/docs/dashboard/USER_GUIDE) to complete the operation through a web UI.

![enable hmac plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/apisix/master/docs/assets/images/plugin/hmac-auth-2.png)
-->

Next, you can configure the Plugin to a Route or a Service:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/index.html",
    "plugins": {
        "hmac-auth": {}
    },
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'
```

## Example usage

### Generating the signature

The formula for calculating the signature is `signature = HMAC-SHAx-HEX(secret_key, signing_string)`.

In order to generate the signature, two parameters, `secret_key` and `signing_string` are required. The `secret_key` is configured by a Consumer and the `signing_string` is calculated as `signing_string = HTTP Method + \n + HTTP URI + \n + canonical_query_string + \n + access_key + \n + Date + \n + signed_headers_string`. The different terms in this calculation are explained below:

- **HTTP Method** : HTTP request method in uppercase. For example, GET, PUT, POST etc.
- **HTTP URI** : HTTP URI. Should start with "/" and "/" denotes an empty path.
- **Date** : Date in the HTTP header in GMT format.
- **canonical_query_string** : The result of encoding the query string in the URL (the string "key1 = value1 & key2 = value2" after the "?" in the URL).
- **signed_headers_string** : Concatenation of the specified request headers.

:::tip

If any of the terms are missing, they are replaced by an empty string.

:::

**The algorithm for generating `canonical_query_string` is described below:**

1. Extract the query terms from the URL.
2. Split the query terms into key-value pairs by using `&` as the separator.
3. If `encode_uri_params` is `true`:
   1. If there are only keys, the conversion formula is `uri_encode(key) + "="`.
   2. If there are both keys and values, the conversion formula is `uri_encode(key) + "=" + uri_encode(value)`. Here, the value can even be an empty string.
   3. Sort by key in lexicographic order and connect them with & symbol to generate the corresponding `canonical_query_string`.
4. If `encode_uri_params` is `false`:
   1. If there are only keys, the conversion formula is `key + "="`.
   2. If there are both keys and values, the conversion formula is `key + "=" + value`. Here, the value can even be an empty string.
   3. Sort by key in lexicographic order and connect them with & symbol to generate the corresponding `canonical_query_string`.

And the algorithm for generating the `signed_headers_string` is as follows:

1. Obtain the specified headers to add to the calculation from the request header.
2. Splice the specified headers in `name:value` format. This is the `signed_headers_string`.

```plain
HeaderKey1 + ":" + HeaderValue1 + "\n"\+
HeaderKey2 + ":" + HeaderValue2 + "\n"\+
...
HeaderKeyN + ":" + HeaderValueN + "\n"
```

The example below shows signature string splicing:

```shell
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9080/index.html?name=james&age=36 \
-H "X-HMAC-SIGNED-HEADERS: User-Agent;x-custom-a" \
-H "x-custom-a: test" \
-H "User-Agent: curl/7.29.0"
```

### Explanation of signature generation formula process

1. The default HTTP Method for the above request is GET, which gives `signing_string` as

```plain
"GET"
```

2. The requested URI is `/index.html`, and the `signing_string` is obtained from the HTTP Method + \n + HTTP URI as

```plain
"GET
/index.html"
```

3. The query item in the URL is `name=james&age=36`, assuming that `encode_uri_params` is false.
According to the algorithm of `canonical_query_string`, the focus is on dictionary sorting of `key` to get `age=36&name=james`.

```plain
"GET
/index.html
age=36&name=james"
```

4. The `access_key` is `user-key`, and the `signing_string` is obtained from HTTP Method + \n + HTTP URI + \n + canonical_query_string + \n + access_key as

```plain
"GET
/index.html
age=36&name=james
user-key"
```

5. Date is in GMT format, as in `Tue, 19 Jan 2021 11:33:20 GMT`, and the `signing_string` is obtained from the  HTTP Method + \n + HTTP URI + \n + canonical_query_string + \n + access_key + \n + Date as

```plain
"GET
/index.html
age=36&name=james
user-key
Tue, 19 Jan 2021 11:33:20 GMT"
```

6. `signed_headers_string` is used to specify the headers involved in the signature, which in the above example includes `User-Agent: curl/7.29.0` and `x-custom-a: test`.

And the `signing_string` is obtained from the HTTP Method + \n + HTTP URI + \n + canonical_query_string + \n + access_key + \n + Date + \n as

```plain
"GET
/index.html
age=36&name=james
user-key
Tue, 19 Jan 2021 11:33:20 GMT
User-Agent:curl/7.29.0
x-custom-a:test
"
```

The Python code below shows how to generate the signature:

```python
import base64
import hashlib
import hmac

secret = bytes('my-secret-key', 'utf-8')
message = bytes("""GET
/index.html
age=36&name=james
user-key
Tue, 19 Jan 2021 11:33:20 GMT
User-Agent:curl/7.29.0
x-custom-a:test
""", 'utf-8')

hash = hmac.new(secret, message, hashlib.sha256)

# to lowercase base64
print(base64.b64encode(hash.digest()))
```

| Type      | Hash                                         |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| SIGNATURE | 8XV1GB7Tq23OJcoz6wjqTs4ZLxr9DiLoY4PxzScWGYg= |

You can also refer to [Generating HMAC signatures](../examples/plugins-hmac-auth-generate-signature.md) for how to generate signatures for different programming languages.

### Validating request body

When the `validate_request_body` attribute is set to `true`, the Plugin will calculate the HMAC-SHA value of the request body and checks it again the `X-HMAC-DIGEST` header:

```
X-HMAC-DIGEST: base64(hmac-sha(<body>))
```

If there is no request body, you can set the `X-HMAC-DIGEST` value to the HMAC-SHA of an empty string.

:::note

To calculate the digest of the request body, the Plugin will load the body to memory which can cause high memory consumption if the body is large. To avoid this, you can limit the max allowed body size by configuring `max_req_body` (default 512KB). Request bodies larger than the set size will be rejected.

:::

### Using the generated signature to make requests

You can now use the generated signature to make requests as shown below:

```shell
curl -i "http://127.0.0.1:9080/index.html?name=james&age=36" \
-H "X-HMAC-SIGNATURE: 8XV1GB7Tq23OJcoz6wjqTs4ZLxr9DiLoY4PxzScWGYg=" \
-H "X-HMAC-ALGORITHM: hmac-sha256" \
-H "X-HMAC-ACCESS-KEY: user-key" \
-H "Date: Tue, 19 Jan 2021 11:33:20 GMT" \
-H "X-HMAC-SIGNED-HEADERS: User-Agent;x-custom-a" \
-H "x-custom-a: test" \
-H "User-Agent: curl/7.29.0"
```

```shell
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: keep-alive
Date: Tue, 19 Jan 2021 11:33:20 GMT
Server: APISIX/2.2
......
```

The signature can be put in the `Authorization` header of the request:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/index.html -H 'Authorization: hmac-auth-v1# + ACCESS_KEY + # + base64_encode(SIGNATURE) + # + ALGORITHM + # + DATE + # + SIGNED_HEADERS' -i
```

```shell
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 13175
...
Accept-Ranges: bytes

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="cn">
...
```

Or, the signature can be placed separately in another request header:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/index.html -H 'X-HMAC-SIGNATURE: base64_encode(SIGNATURE)' -H 'X-HMAC-ALGORITHM: ALGORITHM' -H 'Date: DATE' -H 'X-HMAC-ACCESS-KEY: ACCESS_KEY' -H 'X-HMAC-SIGNED-HEADERS: SIGNED_HEADERS' -i
```

```shell
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 13175
...
Accept-Ranges: bytes

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="cn">
```

:::note

1. If there are multiple signed headers, they must be separated by `;`. For example, `x-custom-header-a;x-custom-header-b`.
2. `SIGNATURE` needs to be base64 encoded for encryption.

:::

### Using custom header keys

You can use custom header keys for the auth parameters by changing the `plugin_attr` in your configuration file (`conf/config.yaml`):

```yaml
plugin_attr:
  hmac-auth:
    signature_key: X-APISIX-HMAC-SIGNATURE
    algorithm_key: X-APISIX-HMAC-ALGORITHM
    date_key: X-APISIX-DATE
    access_key: X-APISIX-HMAC-ACCESS-KEY
    signed_headers_key: X-APISIX-HMAC-SIGNED-HEADERS
    body_digest_key: X-APISIX-HMAC-BODY-DIGEST
```

Now you can use the new keys while making a request:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/index.html \
-H 'X-APISIX-HMAC-SIGNATURE: base64_encode(SIGNATURE)' \
-H 'X-APISIX-HMAC-ALGORITHM: ALGORITHM' \
-H 'X-APISIX-DATE: DATE' \
-H 'X-APISIX-HMAC-ACCESS-KEY: ACCESS_KEY' \
-H 'X-APISIX-HMAC-SIGNED-HEADERS: SIGNED_HEADERS' \
-H 'X-APISIX-HMAC-BODY-DIGEST: BODY_DIGEST' -i
```

```shell
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 13175
...
Accept-Ranges: bytes

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="cn">
```

## Disable Plugin

To disable the `hmac-auth` Plugin, you can delete the corresponding JSON configuration from the Plugin configuration. APISIX will automatically reload and you do not have to restart for this to take effect.

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/index.html",
    "plugins": {},
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'
```
