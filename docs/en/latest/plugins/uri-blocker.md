## Name

The plugin helps we intercept user requests, we only need to indicate the `block_rules`.

## Attributes

| Name          | Type          | Requirement | Default | Valid      | Description                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| block_rules   | array[string] | required    |         |            | Regular filter rule array. Each of these items is a regular rule. If the current request URI hits any one of them, set the response code to rejected_code to exit the current user request. Example: `["root.exe", "root.m+"]`. |
| rejected_code | integer       | optional    | 403     | [200, ...] | The HTTP status code returned when the request URI hit any of `block_rules` |

## How To Enable

Here's an example, enable the `uri blocker` plugin on the specified route:

```shell
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/*",
    "plugins": {
        "uri-blocker": {
            "block_rules": ["root.exe", "root.m+"]
        }
    },
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'
```

## Test Plugin

$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9080/root.exe?a=a

```

## Disable Plugin

When you want to disable the `uri blocker` plugin, it is very simple, you can delete the corresponding json configuration in the plugin configuration, no need to restart the service, it will take effect immediately:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/*",
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'
```

The `uri blocker` plugin has been disabled now. It works for other plugins.
