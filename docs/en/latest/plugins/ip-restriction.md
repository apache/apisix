## Name

The `ip-restriction` can restrict access to a Service or a Route by either
whitelisting or blacklisting IP addresses. Single IPs, multiple IPs or ranges
in CIDR notation like 10.10.10.0/24 can be used.

## Attributes

| Name      | Type          | Requirement | Default | Valid | Description                              |
| --------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| whitelist | array[string] | optional    |         |       | List of IPs or CIDR ranges to whitelist. |
| blacklist | array[string] | optional    |         |       | List of IPs or CIDR ranges to blacklist. |

One of `whitelist` or `blacklist` must be specified, and they can not work
together.

## How To Enable

Creates a route or service object, and enable plugin `ip-restriction`.

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/index.html",
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    },
    "plugins": {
        "ip-restriction": {
            "whitelist": [
                "127.0.0.1",
                "113.74.26.106/24"
            ]
        }
    }
}'
```

## Test Plugin

Requests from `127.0.0.1`:

```shell
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/index.html -i
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
```

Requests from `127.0.0.2`:

```shell
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/index.html -i --interface 127.0.0.2

```

## Change the restriction

When you want to change the whitelisted ip, it is very simple,
you can send the corresponding json configuration in the plugin configuration,
no need to restart the service, it will take effect immediately:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/index.html",
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    },
    "plugins": {
        "ip-restriction": {
            "whitelist": [
                "127.0.0.2",
                "113.74.26.106/24"
            ]
        }
    }
}'
```

## Test Plugin after restriction change

Requests from `127.0.0.2`:

```shell
$ curl http://127.0.0.2:9080/index.html -i --interface 127.0.0.2
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
```

Requests from `127.0.0.1`:

```

## Disable Plugin

When you want to disable the `ip-restriction` plugin, it is very simple,
you can delete the corresponding json configuration in the plugin configuration,
no need to restart the service, it will take effect immediately:

```shell
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:2379/v2/keys/apisix/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d value='
{
    "uri": "/index.html",
    "plugins": {},
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "39.97.63.215:80": 1
        }
    }
}'
```

The `ip-restriction` plugin has been disabled now. It works for other plugins.
