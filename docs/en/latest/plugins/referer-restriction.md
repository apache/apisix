```shell
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/index.html -H 'Referer: http://xx.com/x'
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
```

Request with `Referer: http://yy.com/x`:

```shell
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/index.html -H 'Referer: http://yy.com/x'
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
...
{"message":"Your referer host is not allowed"}
```

```shell
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/index.html
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
```

## Disable Plugin

When you want to disable the `referer-restriction` plugin, it is very simple,
you can delete the corresponding json configuration in the plugin configuration,
no need to restart the service, it will take effect immediately:

```shell
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:2379/v2/keys/apisix/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d value='
{
    "uri": "/index.html",
    "plugins": {},
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "39.97.63.215:80": 1
        }
    }
}'
```

The `referer-restriction` plugin has been disabled now. It works for other plugins.
