## Description

The `node-status` Plugin can be used get the status of requests to APISIX by exposing an API endpoint.

## Attributes

None.

## API

This Plugin will add the endpoint `/apisix/status` to expose the status of APISIX.

You may need to use the [public-api](public-api.md) Plugin to expose the endpoint.

## Enabling the Plugin

To configure the `node-status` Plugin, you have to first enable it in your configuration file (`conf/config.yaml`):

```yaml title="conf/config.yaml"
plugins:
  - example-plugin
  - limit-req
  - jwt-auth
  - zipkin
  - node-status
  ......
```

You have to the setup the Route for the status API and expose it using the [public-api](public-api.md) Plugin.

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/ns -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/apisix/status",
    "plugins": {
        "public-api": {}
    }
}'
```

## Example usage

Once you have configured the Plugin, you can make a request to the `apisix/status` endpoint to get the status:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/status -i
```

```shell

Date: Tue, 03 Nov 2020 11:12:55 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
