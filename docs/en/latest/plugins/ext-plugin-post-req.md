## Description

`ext-plugin-post-req` differs from the [ext-plugin-pre-req](./ext-plugin-pre-req.md) Plugin in that it runs after executing the built-in Lua Plugins and before proxying to the Upstream.

You can learn more about the configuration from the [ext-plugin-pre-req](./ext-plugin-pre-req.md) Plugin document.
