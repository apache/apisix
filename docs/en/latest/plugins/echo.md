## Name

`echo` is a useful plugin to help users understand as fully as possible how to develop an APISIX plugin.

This plugin addresses the corresponding functionality in the common phases such as init, rewrite, access, balancer, header filter, body filter and log.

**NOTE: `echo` plugin is written as an example. There are some unhandled cases and you should not use it in the production!**

## Attributes

| Name        | Type   | Requirement | Default | Valid | Description                                  |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------- | ------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
| before_body | string | optional    |         |       | Body before the filter phase.                |
| body        | string | optional    |         |       | Body to replace upstream response.           |
| after_body  | string | optional    |         |       | Body after the modification of filter phase. |
| headers     | object | optional    |         |       | New headers for response                     |

At least one of `before_body`, `body`, and `after_body` must be specified.

## How To Enable

The following is an example on how to enable the echo plugin for a specific route.

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "plugins": {
        "echo": {
            "before_body": "before the body modification "
        }
    },
    "upstream": {
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        },
        "type": "roundrobin"
    },
    "uri": "/hello"
}'
```

## Test Plugin

* success:

```shell
$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9080/hello
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
before the body modification hello world
```

## Disable Plugin

Remove the corresponding json configuration in the plugin configuration to disable the `echo`.
APISIX plugins are hot-reloaded, therefore no need to restart APISIX.

```shell
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:2379/apisix/admin/routes/1  -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d value='
{
    "methods": ["GET"],
    "uri": "/hello",
    "plugins": {},
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'
```
