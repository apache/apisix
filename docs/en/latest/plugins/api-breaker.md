## Description

The `api-breaker` Plugin implements circuit breaker functionality to protect Upstream services.

:::note

Whenever the Upstream service responds with a status code from the configured `unhealthy.http_statuses` list for the configured `unhealthy.failures` number of times, the Upstream service will be considered unhealthy.

The request is then retried in 2, 4, 8, 16 ... seconds until the `max_breaker_sec`.

In an unhealthy state, if the Upstream service responds with a status code from the configured list `healthy.http_statuses` for `healthy.successes` times, the service is considered healthy again.

## Enabling the Plugin

The example below shows how you can configure the Plugin on a specific Route:

```shell
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/1" \
-H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "plugins": {
        "api-breaker": {
            "break_response_code": 502,
            "unhealthy": {
                "http_statuses": [500, 503],
                "failures": 3
            },
            "healthy": {
                "http_statuses": [200],
                "successes": 1
            }
        }
    },
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    },
    "uri": "/hello",
}'
```

In this configuration, a response code of `500` or `503` three times within a certain period of time triggers the unhealthy status of the Upstream service. A response code of `200` restores its healthy status.

## Example usage

Once you have configured the Plugin as shown above, you can test it out by sending a request.

```shell
curl -i -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:9080/hello"
```

If the Upstream service responds with an unhealthy response code, you will receive the configured response code (`break_response_code`).

```shell
HTTP/1.1 502 Bad Gateway
...
<html>
<head><title>502 Bad Gateway</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>502 Bad Gateway</h1></center>
<hr><center>openresty</center>
</body>
</html>
```

## Disable Plugin

To disable the `api-breaker` Plugin, you can delete the corresponding JSON configuration from the Plugin configuration. APISIX will automatically reload and you do not have to restart for this to take effect.

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/1 \
-H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/hello",
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'
```
