## Description

The `ai-rate-limiting` plugin enforces token-based rate limiting for requests sent to LLM services. It helps manage API usage by controlling the number of tokens consumed within a specified time frame, ensuring fair resource allocation and preventing excessive load on the service. It is often used with `ai-proxy` or `ai-proxy-multi` plugin.

If `limit` is configured, `time_window` also needs to be configured. Else, just specifying `instances` will also suffice.

## Example

Create a route as such and update with your LLM providers, models, API keys, and endpoints:

```shell
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes" -X PUT \
  -H "X-API-KEY: ${ADMIN_API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "id": "ai-rate-limiting-route",
    "uri": "/anything",
    "methods": ["POST"],
    "plugins": {
      "ai-proxy": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "auth": {
          "header": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer '"$API_KEY"'"
          }
        },
        "options": {
          "model": "gpt-35-turbo-instruct",
          "max_tokens": 512,
          "temperature": 1.0
        }
      },
      "ai-rate-limiting": {
        "limit": 300,
        "time_window": 30,
        "limit_strategy": "prompt_tokens"
      }
    }
  }'
```

Send a POST request to the route with a system prompt and a sample user question in the request body:

```shell
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9080/anything" -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      { "role": "system", "content": "You are a mathematician" },
      { "role": "user", "content": "What is 1+1?" }
    ]
  }'
```

You should receive a response similar to the following:

```json
{
  ...
  "model": "deepseek-chat",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "1 + 1 equals 2. This is a fundamental arithmetic operation where adding one unit to another results in a total of two units."
      },
      "logprobs": null,
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

If rate limiting quota of 300 tokens has been consumed in a 30-second window, the additional requests will all be rejected.
