$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/hello -i

hello world
```

> Since the specified mirror address is 127.0.0.1:9797, so to verify whether this plugin is in effect, we need to confirm on the service with port 9797.
> For example, we can start a simple server:  python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9797

## Disable Plugin

Remove the corresponding JSON in the plugin configuration to disable the plugin immediately without restarting the service:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1  -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/hello",
    "plugins": {},
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1999": 1
        }
    }
}'
```

The plugin has been disabled now.
