## Description

The proxy-control Plugin dynamically controls the behavior of the NGINX proxy.

:::info IMPORTANT

This Plugin requires APISIX to run on [APISIX-Base](../FAQ.md#how-do-i-build-the-apisix-base-environment). See [apisix-build-tools](https://github.com/api7/apisix-build-tools) for more info.

## Attributes

| Name              | Type    | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| request_buffering | boolean | False    | true    | When set to `true`, the Plugin dynamically sets the [`proxy_request_buffering`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_request_buffering) directive. |

## Enabling the Plugin

The example below enables the Plugin on a specific Route:

```shell
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/1 \
  -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/upload",
    "plugins": {
        "proxy-control": {
            "request_buffering": false
        }
    },
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'
```

## Example usage

The example below shows the use case of uploading a big file:

```shell
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9080/upload -d @very_big_file
```

It's expected to not find a message "a client request body is buffered to a temporary file" in the error log.

## Disable Plugin

To disable the `proxy-control` Plugin, you can delete the corresponding JSON configuration from the Plugin configuration. APISIX will automatically reload and you do not have to restart for this to take effect.

```shell
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/1 \
  -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/upload",
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'
```
