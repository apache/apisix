## Description

The `key-auth` Plugin is used to add an authentication key (API key) to a Route or a Service.

This works well with a [Consumer](../terminology/consumer.md). Consumers of the API can then add their key to the query string or the header to authenticate their requests.

## Attributes

For Consumer:

| Name | Type   | Requirement | Description                |
|------|--------|-------------|----------------------------|
| key  | string | required    | Unique key for a Consumer. This field supports saving the value in Secret Manager using the [APISIX Secret](../terminology/secret.md) resource. |

NOTE: `encrypt_fields = {"key"}` is also defined in the schema, which means that the field will be stored encrypted in etcd. See [encrypted storage fields](../plugin-develop.md#encrypted-storage-fields).

For Route:

| Name   | Type   | Requirement | Default | Valid | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| header | string | optional    | apikey  |       | The header to get the key from.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| query  | string | optional    | apikey  |       | The query string to get the key from. Lower priority than header.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| hide_credentials   | bool | optional    | false        |       | Apache APISIX will pass the request header or query string that contains the authentication information to the Upstream if `hide_credentials` is `false`. Otherwise the authentication information will be removed before proxying.|

## Enabling the Plugin

To enable the Plugin, you have to create a Consumer object with an authentication key and configure your Route to authenticate requests.

First you can create a Consumer object through the [Admin API](../admin-api.md) with a unique key:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/consumers -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "username": "jack",
    "plugins": {
        "key-auth": {
            "key": "auth-one"
        }
    }
}'
```

You can also use the [APISIX Dashboard](/docs/dashboard/USER_GUIDE) to complete the operation through a web UI.

First, create a Consumer object:

![create a consumer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/apisix/master/docs/assets/images/plugin/key-auth-1.png)

You can then add the `key-auth` Plugin:

![enable key-auth plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/apisix/master/docs/assets/images/plugin/key-auth-2.png)

Once you have created a Consumer object, you can then configure a Route or a Service to authenticate requests:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "methods": ["GET"],
    "uri": "/index.html",
    "id": 1,
    "plugins": {
        "key-auth": {}
    },
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'
```

To fetch the key from a different header than `apikey`, change the `header` in the configuration:

```json
{
    "key-auth": {
        "header": "Authorization"
    }
}
```

## Example usage

After you have configured the Plugin as mentioned above, you can make a request as shown:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.2:9080/index.html -H 'apikey: auth-one' -i
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
```

And if the request has a missing key or a wrong key:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.2:9080/index.html -i
```

```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
...
{"message":"Missing API key found in request"}
```

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.2:9080/index.html -H 'apikey: abcabcabc' -i
```

```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
...
{"message":"Invalid API key in request"}
```

## Disable Plugin

To disable the `key-auth` Plugin, you can delete the corresponding JSON configuration from the Plugin configuration. APISIX will automatically reload and you do not have to restart for this to take effect.

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/index.html",
    "plugins": {},
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'
```
