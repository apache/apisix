## Name

The `real-ip` plugin dynamically changes the client's IP and port seen by APISIX.

It works like Nginx's `ngx_http_realip_module`, but is more flexible.

**This plugin requires APISIX to run on [APISIX-OpenResty](../how-to-build.md#step-6-build-openresty-for-apache-apisix).**

## Attributes

| Name      | Type          | Requirement | Default    | Valid                                                                    | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| --------- | ------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| source      | string        | required    |            | Any Nginx variable like `arg_realip` or `http_x_forwarded_for`| dynamically set the client's IP and port in APISIX's view, according to the value of variable. If the value doesn't contain a port, the client's port won't be changed. |

If the remote address comes from `source` is missing or invalid, this plugin will just let it go and don't change the client address.

## How To Enable

{
    "uri": "/index.html",
    "plugins": {
        "real-ip": {
            "source": "arg_realip"
        },
        "response-rewrite": {
            "headers": {
                "remote_addr": "$remote_addr",
                "remote_port": "$remote_port"
            }
        }
    },
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'
```

## Test Plugin

Use curl to access:

```shell
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:9080/index.html?realip=1.2.3.4:9080' -I
...
remote-addr: 1.2.3.4
remote-port: 9080
```

## Disable Plugin

When you want to disable this plugin, it is very simple,
you can delete the corresponding JSON configuration in the plugin configuration,
no need to restart the service, it will take effect immediately:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1  -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/index.html",
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'
```

This plugin has been disabled now. It works for other plugins.
