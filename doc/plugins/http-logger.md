                 "uri": "127.0.0.1:80/postendpoint?param=1",
            }
       },
      "upstream": {
           "type": "roundrobin",
           "nodes": {
               "127.0.0.1:1980": 1

```shell
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:2379/apisix/admin/routes/1  -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d value='
{
    "methods": ["GET"],
    "uri": "/hello",
    "plugins": {},
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'
```
