## Name

`udp-logger` is a plugin which push Log data requests to UDP servers.

This will provide the ability to send Log data requests as JSON objects to Monitoring tools and other UDP servers.

This plugin provides the ability to push Log data as a batch to you're external UDP servers. In case if you did not recieve the log data don't worry give it some time it will automatically send the logs after the timer function expires in our Batch Processor.

For more info on Batch-Processor in Apache APISIX please refer.

## How To Enable

The following is an example on how to enable the udp-logger for a specific route.

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/5 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
      "plugins": {
            "udp-logger": {
                 "host": "127.0.0.1",
                 "port": 3000,
                 "batch_max_size": 1,
                 "name": "udp logger"
            }
       },
      "upstream": {
           "type": "roundrobin",
           "nodes": {
               "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
           }
      },
      "uri": "/hello"
}'
```

## Test Plugin

* success:

```shell
$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9080/hello
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
hello, world
```

## Disable Plugin

Remove the corresponding json configuration in the plugin configuration to disable the `udp-logger`.
APISIX plugins are hot-reloaded, therefore no need to restart APISIX.

```shell
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:2379/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d value='
{
    "methods": ["GET"],
    "uri": "/hello",
    "plugins": {},
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'
```
