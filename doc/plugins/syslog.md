## How To Enable

The following is an example on how to enable the sys-logger for a specific route.

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/consumers -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "username": "foo",
    "plugins": {
          "plugins": {
                "syslog": {
                     "host" : "127.0.0.1",
                     "port" : 5044,
                     "flush_limit" : 1
                  }
           },
          "upstream": {
               "type": "roundrobin",
               "nodes": {
                   "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
               }
          },
          "uri": "/hello"
    }
}'
```

## Test Plugin

* success:

```shell
$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9080/hello
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
hello, world
```

## Disable Plugin

Remove the corresponding json configuration in the plugin configuration to disable the `sys-logger`.
APISIX plugins are hot-reloaded, therefore no need to restart APISIX.

```shell
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:2379/apisix/admin/routes/1  -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d value='
{
    "methods": ["GET"],
    "uri": "/hello",
    "plugins": {},
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "127.0.0.1:1980": 1
        }
    }
}'
```
