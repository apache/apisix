Deploy
=======

### AWS

The recommended approach is to deploy APISIX with [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) on [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) which helps you decouple the APISIX layer and the upstream layer on top of a fully-managed and secure serverless container compute environment with autoscaling capabilities.

See [this guide](https://github.com/pahud/cdk-samples/blob/master/typescript/apisix/README.md) by [Pahud Hsieh](https://github.com/pahud) and learn how to provision the recommended architecture 100% in AWS CDK.

### Kubernetes

See [this guide](../kubernetes/README.md) and learn how to deploy apisix in Kubernetes.
