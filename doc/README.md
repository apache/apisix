## Plugins

### General

* [batch-requests](plugins/batch-requests.md): Allow you send multiple http api via **http pipeline**.
* [hot reload](plugins.md): Hot reload without reload service.
* [HTTPS/TLS](https.md): Dynamic load the SSL Certificate by Server Name Indication (SNI).

## Deploy

### AWS

The recommended approach is to deploy APISIX with [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) on [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) which helps you decouple the APISIX layer and the upstream layer on top of a fully-managed and secure serverless container compute environment with autoscaling capabilities.

### Kubernetes

See [this guide](../kubernetes/README.md) and learn how to deploy apisix in Kubernetes.
