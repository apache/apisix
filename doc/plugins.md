## Hot reload

APISIX plug-ins are hot-loaded. No matter you add, delete or modify plug-ins, you don't need to restart the service.

Just send an HTTP request through admin API:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/plugins/reload -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT
```
