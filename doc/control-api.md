The control API can be used to
* expose APISIX internal state
* control the behavior of a single isolate APISIX data panel

By default, the control API server is enabled and listens to `127.0.0.1:9090`. You can change it via
the `control` section under `apisix` in `conf/config.yaml`:

```yaml
apisix:
  ...
  enable_control: true
  control:
    ip: "127.0.0.1"
    port: 9090
```

Note that the control API server should not be configured to listen to the public traffic!

## Control API Added via plugin

Plugin can add its control API when it is enabled.
If a plugin adds such a control API, please refer to each plugin's documentation for those APIs.

## Plugin independent Control API

Here is the supported API:

### GET /v1/schema

Introduced since `v2.2`.

Return the jsonschema used by this APISIX instance.
