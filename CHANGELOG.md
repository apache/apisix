## 0.8.0
> Released on 2019/09/30

This release brings many new features, such as stream proxy, support MQTT protocol proxy,
and support for ARM platform, and proxy rewrite plugin.

### Core
- :sunrise: **[support stand-alone mode](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/blob/master/doc/stand-alone-cn.md)**: using yaml to update configurations of APISIX, more friendly to kubernetes. [#464](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/pull/464)
- :sunrise: **[support stream proxy](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/blob/master/doc/stream-proxy.md)**. [#513](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/pull/513)
- :sunrise: support consumer bind plugins. [#544](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/pull/544)
- support domain name in upstream, not only IP. [#522](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/pull/522)
- ignored upstream node when it's weight is 0. [#536](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/pull/536)

### Plugins
- :sunrise: **[MQTT Proxy](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/blob/master/doc/plugins/mqtt-proxy.md)**: support to load balance MQTT by `client_id`, both support MQTT 3.1 and 5.0. [#513](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/pull/513)
- [proxy-rewrite](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/blob/master/doc/plugins/proxy-rewrite.md): rewrite uri,
 schema, host for upstream. [#594](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/pull/594)

### ARM
- :sunrise: **APISIX can run normally under Ubuntu 18.04 of ARM64 architecture**, so you can use APISIX as IoT gateway with MQTT plugin.

### lua-resty-*
- lua-resty-ipmatcher
    - support IPv6
    - IP white/black list, route.
- lua-resty-radixtree
    - allow to specify multiple host, remote_addr and uri.
    - allow to define user-function to filter request.
    - use `lua-resty-ipmatcher` instead of `lua-resty-iputils`, `lua-resty-ipmatcher` matches fast and support IPv6.


### Bugfix
- healthcheck: the checker name is wrong if APISIX works under multiple processes. [#568](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/issues/568)

### Dependencies
- removed `lua-tinyyaml` from source code base, and install through Luarocks.

## 0.7.0

> Released on 2019/09/06

This release brings many new features, such as IP black and white list, gPRC protocol transcoding, IPv6, IdP (identity provider) services, serverless, Change the default route to radix tree (**not downward compatible**), and more.

### Core
- :sunrise: **[gRPC transcoding](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/blob/master/doc/plugins/grpc-transcoding.md)**: supports protocol transcoding so that clients can access your gRPC API by using HTTP/JSON. [#395](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/issues/395)
- :sunrise: **[radix tree router](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/blob/master/doc/router-radixtree.md)**: The radix tree is used as the default router implementation. It supports the uri, host, cookie, request header, request parameters, Nginx built-in variables, etc. as the routing conditions, and supports common operators such as equal, greater than, less than, etc., more powerful and flexible.**IMPORTANT: This change is not downward compatible. All users who use historical versions need to manually modify their routing to work properly.** [#414](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/issues/414)
- Dynamic upstream supports more parameters, you can specify the upstream uri and host, and whether to enable websocket. [#451](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/pull/451)
- Support for get values from cookies directly from `ctx.var`. [#449](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/pull/449)
- Routing support IPv6. [#331](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/issues/331)

### Plugins
- :sunrise: **[serverless](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/blob/master/doc/plugins/serverless.md)**: With serverless support, users can dynamically run any Lua function on a gateway node. Users can also use this feature as a lightweight plugin.[#86](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/pull/86)
- :sunrise: **support IdP**: Support external authentication services, such as Auth0, okta, etc., users can use this to connect to Oauth2.0 and other authentication methods. [#447](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/pull/447)
- [rate limit](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/blob/master/doc/plugins/limit-conn.md): Support for more restricted keys, such as `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP`, and allows users to use Nginx variables, request headers, and request parameters as keys. [#228](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/issues/228)
- [IP black and white list](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/blob/master/doc/plugins/ip-restriction.md) Support IP black and white list for security. [#398](https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/pull/398)

### CLI
